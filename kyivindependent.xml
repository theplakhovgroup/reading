Explosions were also heard in the southern city of Simferopol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Residents reported seeing drones in the area where the explosions were reported. Local occupation authorities in Sevastopol also reported Ukrainian drones overhead, as well as the threat of ballistic missiles in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The occupied peninsula has been repeatedly targeted by Ukrainian drone and naval strikes, forcing Russian forces to withdraw much of its &lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/russia-continues-to-redeploy-black-sea-fleet/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;naval power&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and beef up &lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/budanov-russia-places-s-500-air-defense-systems-in-occupied-crimea/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;air defenses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Ukrainian &lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/explosions-reported-in-crimea-amid-claims-of-drone-attacks/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;attack&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on occupied &lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/tag/crimea/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crimea&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on July 23 resulted in a ferry used by Russian forces to transport military equipment being "seriously damaged," the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/long-an-olympic-powerhouse-russia-has-the-smallest-participation-in-30-years/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/long-an-olympic-powerhouse-russia-has-the-smallest-participation-in-30-years/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/long-an-olympic-powerhouse-russia-has-the-smallest-participation-in-30-years/"&gt;Long an Olympic powerhouse, Russia has the smallest participation in 30 years&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/long-an-olympic-powerhouse-russia-has-the-smallest-participation-in-30-years/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/long-an-olympic-powerhouse-russia-has-the-smallest-participation-in-30-years/"&gt;Russia, as well as the Soviet Union before it, has long sought to use international sporting spectacles as an opportunity to demonstrate the nation&#8217;s athletic prowess and improve its prestige on the global stage.

First used on the battlefield, they are now typically deployed to target energy infrastructure and cities far from the front line, such as Kyiv.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Cherniak, Russia is now using not only &lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/tag/shahed-drones/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shahed-type drones&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; but also a new type of drone made of plywood and plastic foam in long-range attacks against Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new drones can reveal the location of air defense systems and film damage, with one type able to carry a camera and Ukrainian sim card to send footage back to Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They identify where our mobile groups are positioned, where the machine guns are that can destroy them," &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-deploys-cheap-drones-locate-ukraines-air-defences-2024-07-26/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cherniak told Reuters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russian forces are trying "to get a picture of where all our air defenses are located," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drones have been used in five attacks in July, including an overnight strike on July 25-26, Cherniak said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cherniak's comments follow a report by the &lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/debris-shows-russia-targeted-kyiv-with-new-unidentified-drone/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukrainian Air Force&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on July 20 that a new unidentified drone had targeted Kyiv overnight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Images of the downed &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nexta_tv/status/1814658657268720104"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;drone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; circulating on social media indicate that the new weapon does not resemble a Shahed-type drone. The drone was reportedly flying at a low altitude of 20-30 meters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The news outlet Defense Express obtained additional photographs and details about the unidentified drone. The drone has "a possible wingspan of more than 4 meters, beam plumage, a push rotor, and a square fuselage," Defense Express &lt;a href="https://defence-ua.com/news/scho_tse_za_novij_tajemnichij_dron_kamikadze_jakij_atakuvav_kijiv_foto-16054.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;reported&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, citing its sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Images of the drone show some similarities to the Russian ZALA 421-20 reconnaissance drone, but these types are not widespread and no longer appear in ZALA's current catalog, Defense Express reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/land-on-fire-russias-offensive-in-donetsk-oblast-brings-destruction-to-new-towns/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/land-on-fire-russias-offensive-in-donetsk-oblast-brings-destruction-to-new-towns/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/land-on-fire-russias-offensive-in-donetsk-oblast-brings-destruction-to-new-towns/"&gt;Land on fire: Russia&#8217;s offensive in Donetsk Oblast brings destruction to new towns (Photos)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/land-on-fire-russias-offensive-in-donetsk-oblast-brings-destruction-to-new-towns/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/land-on-fire-russias-offensive-in-donetsk-oblast-brings-destruction-to-new-towns/"&gt;Since February, Russian forces have steadily advanced across multiple sectors of the front in Donetsk Oblast.

Excuse me, I do know such a country &#8211; the Ukrainian People's Republic in 1918. At that time, Defense Minister Mykola Porsh submitted a draft law on demobilization to the Central Rada," Stefanchuk said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is very important to me that the current Verkhovna Rada (&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/tag/parliament/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukraine's parliament&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) does not repeat the 'mistake' of the Central Rada."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Central Rada was an analog of the parliament in the times of the short-lived Ukrainian People's Republic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Vitalii Skalskyi, the director of the Ukrainian Research Institute of Archival Affairs and Records Management, it is a common misconception that the Ukrainian People's Republic carried out demobilization of its regular army in January 1918, eventually leading to its defeat in the war with the Bolsheviks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skalskyi argues that it was not the demobilization of the Ukrainian army but of the &lt;a href="https://www.istpravda.com.ua/articles/5a7c665b9a13a/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;remnants of the old Russian imperial army&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They were absolutely incapable and had no burning desire to fight for Ukraine," Skalskyi told the Kyiv Independent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, Stefanchuk said that the Ukrainian military on the front line "has an exclusive right to justice," which is why it is necessary to provide them with vacations, rotations, or other "privileges."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stefanchuk believes these issues were partially resolved after the new &lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-signs-mobilization-bill/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;law on mobilization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was adopted in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most Ukrainian soldiers cannot legally demobilize. The grounds for demobilization may include health problems or the need to care for sick family members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April, before the law on &lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/tag/mobilization/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;mobilization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was voted on in the second reading, the provisions on demobilization and rotation were removed from it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Defense Ministry said that the parliamentary committee had instructed it to develop a new law within eight months that would deal specifically with rotation and demobilization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ministry later announced in April that it plans to submit the draft law to the parliament in "the next few months." It has not been introduced yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/czech-foreign-minister-ammunition-initiative-is-key-part-of-ukraines-defense-but-needs-more-supporters-money/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/czech-foreign-minister-ammunition-initiative-is-key-part-of-ukraines-defense-but-needs-more-supporters-money/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/czech-foreign-minister-ammunition-initiative-is-key-part-of-ukraines-defense-but-needs-more-supporters-money/"&gt;Czech FM: Ammunition initiative is a vital part of Ukraine&#8217;s defense but needs more donors, money&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/czech-foreign-minister-ammunition-initiative-is-key-part-of-ukraines-defense-but-needs-more-supporters-money/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/czech-foreign-minister-ammunition-initiative-is-key-part-of-ukraines-defense-but-needs-more-supporters-money/"&gt;The Czech ammunition initiative secured financing for half a million shells for Ukraine and can gather more if it finds additional donors or finances, Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky said in an interview with the Kyiv Independent on July 23.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;France blocks dozens of Olympics accreditation applications, citing suspected interference by Russia and Belarus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exiled Belarusian returns home &#8211; is sentenced to six years in prison for donating to a volunteer regiment fighting against Russia in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eduard Babaryka, jailed son of former presidential candidate, given additional 18-month sentence, bringing total term to almost 10 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;code&gt;Minsk, Berlin in talks over German citizen on death row in Belarus over alleged terrorist act&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minsk and Berlin are holding &#8220;consultations&#8221; over the fate of German citizen Rico Krieger, sentenced in Belarus to death by firing squad for terrorism and mercenarism, Belarusian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Anatol Hlaz said on July 20. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hlaz said that &#8220;at the request of Germany&#8217;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs,&#8221; Belarus has &#8220;proposed a number of options for the development of the situation.&#8221; &#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The German Foreign Ministry &lt;a href="https://www.dw.com/ru/grazdanina-germanii-prigovorili-k-smertnoj-kazni-v-belarusi/a-69716511"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; the circumstances of the case to Deutsche Welle, saying the German embassy in Minsk was providing consular support to the German citizen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The death penalty is a cruel and inhumane form of punishment that is rejected by Germany in all circumstances,&#8221; &#8203;&#8203;the ministry was quoted as stating, without providing more details of the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Krieger was &lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/belarus-sentences-german-man-to-death-by-firing-squad-for-terrorism/"&gt;sentenced to death&lt;/a&gt; by a court in Belarus, the Viasna Human Rights Center &lt;a href="https://dp.spring96.org/en/news/115803"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; on July 19. The sentencing occurred on June 24, but details of it emerged only recently, with much of the trial being held behind closed doors. Krieger&#8217;s defense reportedly did not appeal against the sentence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Belarusian propagandist Liudmila Hladkaya, who was allowed into the courtroom, &lt;a href="https://mediazonaby.com/news/2024/07/22/krieger"&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt; that Krieger arrived in Belarus &#8220;as a tourist&#8221; on Oct. 2, 2023. According to Hladkaya, the terrorism charges were pressed in connection with an explosion at a railway station in Azyaryshcha just east of Minsk on Oct. 5, 2023. The station is an important military cargo loading hub for the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Activists from the independent Belarusian railroad workers union said the blast happened on a siding, causing minor damage and no casualties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Viasna Human Rights Center initially linked the charges to a group of volunteer Belarusian soldiers, the &lt;a href="https://kalinouski.org/en/"&gt;Kalinouski Regiment&lt;/a&gt;, which fights against Russia in &lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/tag/ukraine/"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;. The regiment &lt;a href="https://nashaniva.com/347434"&gt;denied&lt;/a&gt; having any connection with the convicted man. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Krieger, 30, &lt;a href="https://zerka1o-browse.online/news/life/73726.html?tg=4"&gt;worked&lt;/a&gt; as a security guard in the U.S. Embassy in Berlin and later as a paramedic for the German Red Cross. The organization confirmed his employment but said Krieger was not part of any of its overseas missions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exiled Belarusian activist Pavel Latushka said that the Belarusian authorities may have jailed Krieger in order to exchange him for a Russian FSB officer, Vadim Krasikov.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Krasikov is currently serving a life sentence in a German prison for the murder of Zelimkhan Khangoshvili, a Georgian-born Chechen dissident who had sought asylum in Germany. Krasikov shot Khangoshvili in Berlin&#8217;s central Tiergarten park in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Belarus remains the only country in Europe with capital punishment. In 2022, the use of the death penalty was &lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/belarus-expands-use-of-death-penalty-democratic-forces-rail-guerrillas-under-threat/"&gt;extended&lt;/a&gt; to apply to &#8220;attempted terrorist acts&#8221; committed by a group or using toxic or radioactive substances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;code&gt;Following death sentence, Belarus extends visa-free travel regime to 35 European nations&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Belarus has broadened its 30-day visa-free travel regime for citizens of 35 European countries to demonstrate Belarusian &#8220;openness and peacefulness,&#8221; the country&#8217;s Foreign Ministry said on July 17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the new policy, effective from July 19, citizens of 35 European countries, including the United Kingdom, Germany and most EU members, will be able to enter Belarus via all land and air checkpoints and stay for 30 days without a visa. The relaxed visa regime will be in effect until the end of 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, Belarus granted visa-free entrance to citizens of Poland, Lithuania, and Latvia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relations between Belarus and its three EU neighbors have soured significantly since Minsk held fraudulent presidential elections in 2020 and later took part in Russia&#8217;s war against Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, other European nationals could enter Belarus without a visa if they arrived at the Minsk airport. However, Belarus was cut off from international flights after a Ryanair commercial flight was grounded in Minsk in 2021. One of the flight&#8217;s passengers, a political opponent of Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko, was taken off the aircraft and arrested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Belarusian political analysts &lt;a href="https://belsat.eu/ru/news/19-07-2024-dlya-kogo-lukashenko-vvel-bezviz-dlya-zapada-kremlya-kitaya-vryad-li-prosto-dlya-turistov"&gt;suggest&lt;/a&gt; that Minsk&#8217;s broadening of its visa-free travel might be a public relations stunt aimed at domestic audiences to contrast the recent &lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/belarus-weekly-4-russian-kamikaze-drones-fly-deep-into-belarusian-airspace-over-past-week/"&gt;bans on Belarus&#8217; registered vehicles &lt;/a&gt;in the Baltic states with allegedly open Belarusian borders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Viasna Human Rights Center &lt;a href="https://spring96.org/be/news/114902"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that 25 foreign citizens were in detention in Belarus on politically motivated charges as of July 1, 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ukrainians constitute the majority of them, following an intensified crackdown by the Belarusian authorities on any support for Ukraine in its war with Russia. In a recent prisoner exchange, Ukraine was able to free five of its prisoners, while at least eight more remain behind bars on charges of espionage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least three citizens of Poland, one Lithuanian, and one Latvian citizen are jailed in Belarus on politically motivated charges. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authorities in Germany, the UK, and the United States advise their citizens against traveling to Belarus due to the risk of arrest and arbitrary persecution. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;code&gt;Poland considers suspending cross-border trade in bid to pressure Lukashenko into halting border crisis&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poland says it will shut down the cross-border transportation of goods with Belarus unless Minsk meets three conditions for normalizing the relations between the two countries, Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Andrzej Szejna &lt;a href="https://wiadomosci.radiozet.pl/Gosc-Radia-ZET/wiceszef-msz-kamala-harris-to-bardzo-potezny-przeciwnik-dla-donalda-trumpa"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; on July 22.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Poland has specific conditions for Belarus if it would like to normalize relations, such as the end of hybrid attacks, the extradition of the killer of a Polish soldier, the release of imprisoned Poles,&#8221; &lt;a href="https://wiadomosci.radiozet.pl/Gosc-Radia-ZET/wiceszef-msz-kamala-harris-to-bardzo-potezny-przeciwnik-dla-donalda-trumpa"&gt;Szejna&lt;/a&gt; said in an interview with Radio Zet, the country&#8217;s second-largest commercial radio station.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warsaw has accused Belarus of deliberately encouraging migrants to illegally cross into Poland. Warsaw stepped up its efforts to end the artificial migration crisis after a Polish soldier was &lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/polish-border-guard-dies-after-being-wounded-in-attack-on-belarusian-border/"&gt;stabbed to death&lt;/a&gt; when trying to stop an illegal border crossing attempt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poland&#8217;s prosecutors say that the attacker remains in Belarus. Polish authorities have demanded his extradition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, Polish and independent Belarusian media &lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/belarus-weekly-4-russian-kamikaze-drones-fly-deep-into-belarusian-airspace-over-past-week/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; a near-full halt of cargo transit at the Malaszewicze railway terminal on the border, and a pause in transit on the only remaining road cargo checkpoint. The media linked the slowdowns with Poland&#8217;s diplomatic efforts to pressure the regime of Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko into ending the migration crisis it has orchestrated on the EU borders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radio Zet also &lt;a href="https://wiadomosci.radiozet.pl/polska/polityka/news-twarde-negocjacje-polski-z-bialorusia-w-tle-calkowite-zamkniecie-przejsc-granicznych?_gl=1*1520lm6*_gcl_au*MTQ1NDExMzE1Ni4xNzE0OTg5MzUx*_ga*NTE3MDk0MzkxLjE3MTQ5ODkzNTE.*_ga_MPM3D93P3J*MTcyMTcyMjIxMi4xNS4wLjE3MjE3MjIyMTIuNjAuMC4xODEyOTU5ODcw"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;, citing sources in diplomatic circles, that Polish Foreign Ministry officials are currently in &#8220;difficult talks&#8221; with Belarus regarding the release of Andrzej Poczobut, a Polish-Belarusian journalist and activist sentenced to eight years in Belarus on politically motivated charges. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/poland-will-do-what-is-needed-end-belarus-border-crisis-says-deputy-minister-2024-07-10/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; on June 22 that Warsaw has not ruled out a full border shutdown. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/is-belarus-occupied-by-russia/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/is-belarus-occupied-by-russia/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/is-belarus-occupied-by-russia/"&gt;With the world looking away, Russia quietly took control over Belarus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/is-belarus-occupied-by-russia/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/is-belarus-occupied-by-russia/"&gt;Talks of dictator Alexander Lukashenko&#8217;s Belarus becoming Russia&#8217;s vassal gained ground in 2020 when the regime violently crushed all forms of descent, with Moscow&#8217;s full backing. Two years later, Lukashenko&#8217;s Belarus is barely independent from the Kremlin. The Belarusian economy is dependent on R&#8230;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/is-belarus-occupied-by-russia/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/is-belarus-occupied-by-russia/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Belarus Weekly: Warsaw gives Minsk 3 conditions to prevent full suspension of goods transit between EU, Belarus" src="https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/size/w256h256/format/png/2023/03/K-new.svg" /&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Kyiv Independent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Maria Yeryoma&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/is-belarus-occupied-by-russia/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/is-belarus-occupied-by-russia/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/is-belarus-occupied-by-russia/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Belarus Weekly: Warsaw gives Minsk 3 conditions to prevent full suspension of goods transit between EU, Belarus" src="https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/02/gettyimages-1243714952-166635270181zf8.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/is-belarus-occupied-by-russia/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;code&gt;France rejects dozens of Olympics accreditation requests over suspicions that Russia, Belarus may attempt to disrupt the event&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;France has rejected dozens of applications for the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris over suspicions that Russia and Belarus might attempt to disrupt the event, French Interior Minister G&#233;rald Darmanin &lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/france-ban-russians-belarusians-suspected-of-foreign-interference-from-attending-paris-olympics/"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; French weekly magazine Journal du Dimanche on July 20. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The French government has also introduced a verification system to boost cybersecurity and ward off disinformation and terror-related threats during the &lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/tag/olympics/"&gt;Olympics&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the slightly under 1 million applications from volunteers, journalists, and personnel that can access the Games&#8217; restricted zones, some 4,340 were declined by the French authorities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In addition to intelligence and traditional espionage, there is the possibility of (agents) gaining access to computer network gateways to carry out a cyberattack,&#8221; Darmanin said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For example, we have turned away large numbers of &#8216;journalists&#8217; claiming to be covering the games.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sixteen Belarusian and 15 Russian athletes have been allowed to compete as neutral individual athletes (NIAs) without their countries&#8217; uniforms, flags and anthems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike the Russian National Olympic Committee, the Belarusian NOC &#8211; headed by Lukashenko&#8217;s oldest son Viktar &#8211; was not suspended. It remains in charge of approving NIAs and the press for participating at the Games. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The independent Belarusian Association of Journalists&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/belarus-weekly-belarusian-propagandists-granted-accreditation-to-2024-paris-olympics/"&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that the IOC had issued accreditations to cover the 2024 Paris Olympics to several representatives of state-owned Belarusian media that promote Russia's aggression against Ukraine, spread propaganda, and publish interrogations of arbitrarily detained persons and political prisoners in Belarus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2024 Paris Olympics will be held between July 26 and Aug. 11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;code&gt;Belarusian sentenced to 6 years for donating to a volunteer regiment in Ukraine&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brest regional court has sentenced a Belarusian citizen to six years in prison for sending money to "representatives of extremist formations, including armed ones, such as Kalinouski Regiment,&#8221; the Belarusian Prosecutor General Office &lt;a href="https://www.prokuratura.gov.by/ru/media/novosti/nadzor-za-resheniyami-po-ugolovnym-i-grazhdanskim-delam/prokuratura-brestsko22072024/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; on July 22. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Viasna Human Rights group &lt;a href="https://spring96.org/be/news/115819"&gt;identified&lt;/a&gt; the accused as a 38-year-old resident of the western city of Brest, Natallia Levaya. According to the prosecution, throughout 2021-2022, Levaya sent around $1,344 to the Kastus Kalinouski regiment, a volunteer formation of Belarusians fighting on the Ukrainian side against Russian aggression. She also allegedly attempted to join the armed group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the prison sentence, the woman was given a $12,000 fine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The independent news outlet Nasha Niva &lt;a href="https://nashaniva.com/347617"&gt;suggests &lt;/a&gt;that Levaya was an artist and illustrator with a Belarusian tech company that relocated its business from Belarus in 2022 over the country&#8217;s involvement in the war against Ukraine. According to Nasha Niva&#8217;s sources, Levaya returned to Belarus from Poland and was detained while crossing the border. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Belarus currently holds over 1,400 political prisoners. On July 2, Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko &lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/belarus-weekly-eu-imposes-new-sanctions-on-belarus-targeting-sanction-circumvention/"&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt; that some "seriously ill&#8221; prisoners might be released. Human rights advocates &lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/belarus-weekly-china-belarus-conduct-joint-drills-near-nato-ukraine-borders/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that 18 prisoners were set free in the subsequent days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, in the meantime 17 more individuals were recognized to be persons prosecuted on politically motivated grounds. Viasna &lt;a href="https://spring96.org/be/news/113901"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; at least 207 individuals were detained upon entering Belarus during 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;code&gt;Jailed son of former presidential candidate given additional 18-month sentence&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eduard Babaryka, the jailed son of former Belarusian presidential candidate and political prisoner Viktar Babaryka, has been sentenced to an additional 18 months in prison for alleged &#8220;malicious disobedience&#8221; while in prison, Belarusian state news agency Belsat&lt;a href="https://belsat.eu/news/12-07-2024-eduardu-babaryku-dadali-pautara-goda-znyavolennya"&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; on July 12. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new sentence has been added to Babaryka&#8217;s previous &lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/belarus-weekly-lukashenko-asks-belarusians-to-calm-down-as-wagners-move-still-undecided/"&gt;eight-year term&lt;/a&gt; for allegedly &#8220;organizing mass disturbances,&#8221; &#8220;inciting hatred,&#8221; and &#8220;evading taxes,&#8221; bringing the total sentence to nearly 10 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of that, 35-year-old Babaryka spent 18 months waiting to be charged in pre-trial detention &#8211; time that was not taken into account in the sentence. He pleaded not guilty and has been declared by human rights organizations to be a political prisoner. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Belarusian authorities have branded Babaryka as &#8220;an extremist&#8221; and &#8220;a terrorist.&#8221; He has reportedly been held in solitary confinement in prison since April 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Criminal Code of Belarus does not limit the number of charges of malicious disobedience that can be leveled against a prisoner, allowing a term behind bars to become virtually endless. Human rights activists in Belarus have &lt;a href="https://pozirk.online/ru/news/62411/"&gt;recorded&lt;/a&gt; several cases of this particular charge being applied against 33 political prisoners, sometimes repeatedly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Babaryka, a businessman, headed his father Viktar&#8217;s election campaign in the 2020. The elder Babaryka was considered to be one of Lukashenko&#8217;s main political opponents during the 2020 Belarusian presidential election. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eduard and Viktar Babaryka were detained on June 18, 2020, while en route to file signatures in favor of Viktar&#8217;s presidential candidacy. The detention effectively took Babaryka out of the presidential race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viktar Babaryka is currently serving a 14-year sentence in Belarus. On April 27, 2023, he was &lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/belarus-weekly-imprisoned-opposition-leader-hospitalized/"&gt;hospitalized&lt;/a&gt; with a collapsed lung and traces of severe beating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has since been held incommunicado for over a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;code&gt;Lukashenko marks 30 years in power&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;em&gt;The &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spotlight&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; segment provides readers with the historical context of contemporary events in Belarus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" /&gt;&lt;source type="image/jpg" /&gt;&lt;img alt="Belarus Weekly: Warsaw gives Minsk 3 conditions to prevent full suspension of goods transit between EU, Belarus" height="683" src="https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-541793098.jpg" width="1024" /&gt;Boris Yeltsin, Alexander Lukashenko and Bill Clinton. (David Brauchli/Sygma via Getty Images)&lt;p&gt;On July 20, 1994, a populist politician and former head of a collective farm &#8211; Alexander Lukashenko &#8211; was inaugurated for his first term as president after winning the country&#8217;s first and&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/belarus-weekly-no-nukes-in-belarus-yet/"&gt; last fair and democratic elections&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the following three decades, Lukashenko built a dictatorship by silencing dissent, reverting to Soviet methods of controlling the economy, and conceding Belarus&#8217; sovereignty to Russia bit by bit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first year of Lukashenko&#8217;s rule was marked by an attack on press freedom and banning publication of anti-corruption reports. Two contested referendums, in &lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/belarus-weekly-lukashenko-makes-brief-public-appearance-following-rumors-of-his-poor-health/"&gt;1995&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/belarus-weekly-putin-attends-the-csto-summit-in-minsk-armenia-skips/"&gt; 1996&lt;/a&gt;, handed Lukashenko the authority to dissolve parliament and granted him virtually unchecked powers in the country. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The country&#8217;s national symbols &#8211; the white-red-white flag and Pahonia coat of arms &#8211; were replaced with Soviet-style insignia, and the Belarusian language was gradually pushed out of public life. Anti-government protests in 1996, known as the Minsk Spring, were brutally oppressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1999 and 2000 four of Lukashenko&#8217;s political opponents disappeared. Former Interior Minister Yury Zakharanka, former Central Election Commission Head Viktar Hanchar, businessman Anatoly Krasousky, and journalist Dzmitry Zavadski are presumed dead. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At around the same time, Lukashenko signed the Union State agreement with Russia. Although the Belarusian dictator claims to have pulled the struggling post-Soviet Belarusian economy back from the edge, the country has grown ever more reliant on subsidized Russian oil and gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To conceal the appalling inflation of the Belarusian ruble, Lukashenko has conducted three re-denominations. Without them, the current exchange rate would be 317.69 million Belarusian rubles to the dollar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Minsk was chosen as a neutral ground for talks between Kyiv and Moscow months into Russia&#8217;s war against Ukraine in 2014, Lukashenko briefly succeeded at branding himself as a &lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/belarus-weekly-lukashenko-brags-about-saving-russia-wagner-boss-ends-up-in-belarus/"&gt;peacemaker&lt;/a&gt;, leading to a gradual lifting of Western sanctions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, mass protests against the rigged 2020 Belarusian presidential elections and a brutal crackdown by the Lukashenko regime on dissents, with over 1,400 political prisoners being jailed, ushered in a fresh wave of Western sanctions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, in 2021, Lukashenko ordered the forced landing of a passenger flight to arrest a political opponent and engineered the ongoing migration crisis on the Belarusian-EU border. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2022, he turned the country into a co-aggressor in Russia's war against Ukraine by opening the country&#8217;s territory for a Russian attack on Kyiv. While not committing his troops to the battlefield, Lukashenko supported Russia&#8217;s nuclear blackmail and agreed to host mercenaries from Russia&#8217;s Wagner Group in 2023. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four years into a still deepening political crisis, Lukashenko has set himself up for reelection in 2025, jailing more political opponents and continuing to support Russia's war efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/after-sham-parliamentary-elections-lukashenko-tightens-grip-on-power-in-belarus/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/after-sham-parliamentary-elections-lukashenko-tightens-grip-on-power-in-belarus/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/after-sham-parliamentary-elections-lukashenko-tightens-grip-on-power-in-belarus/"&gt;Lukashenko tightens grip on power as regime prepares for new elections&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/after-sham-parliamentary-elections-lukashenko-tightens-grip-on-power-in-belarus/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/after-sham-parliamentary-elections-lukashenko-tightens-grip-on-power-in-belarus/"&gt;Around a month before Russia held its presidential elections that were neither free nor fair, Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko held his own election-style event.

At least 50 athletes were killed in acts that amount to war crimes committed by Russian troops during the occupation of Ukrainian territories, the ministry said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;code&gt;Fedir Yepifanov&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" /&gt;&lt;source type="image/jpg" /&gt;&lt;img alt="Ukrainian athletes who will never have a chance to compete at the Olympics" src="https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/Fedir-Yepifanov.jpg" /&gt;Fedir Yepifanov in an undated photo.

Hulenkov refused and went missing a few weeks before the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He told me: 'I cannot leave my brothers,'" Chernov said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In memory of his friend, Chernov carries a badge with Hulenkov's name on it to judo competitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-olympics-flag-bearers/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-olympics-flag-bearers/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-olympics-flag-bearers/"&gt;Tennis player Svitolina, swimmer Romanchuk to carry Ukrainian flags at Olympics opening ceremony&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-olympics-flag-bearers/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-olympics-flag-bearers/"&gt;Svitolina and Romanchuk were medalists at the previous Olympics in Tokyo.

Earlier this year, President Volodymyr Zelensky extended an invitation to &lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/https-kyivindependent-com-ghost-editor-post-646a606ec03063b7d27a8fd8/"&gt;Modi&lt;/a&gt; during a telephone conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This month witnessed high-level exchanges between the two countries. External Affairs Minister (EAM) Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and Ukraine's Foreign Minister &lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-cant-wait-another-75-years-to-celebrate-nato-accession-kuleba-says/"&gt;Dmytro Kuleba&lt;/a&gt;, as well as National Security Advisor (NSA) Ajit Doval and his Ukrainian counterpart Andriy Yermak, held telephone discussions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following these talks, Jaishankar &lt;a href="https://x.com/DrSJaishankar/status/1814238699305189400?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1814238699305189400%7Ctwgr%5E2a7ac592d0f80e4368aa34d77c6420ec8b908117%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wionews.com%2Findia-news%2Findian-pm-narendra-modi-to-visit-ukraine-in-august-744593"&gt;shared&lt;/a&gt; on social media that the discussions focused on "further developing our bilateral relationship."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June, Modi met with Zelensky in Italy during the &lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/g7-to-finalize-plan-by-october/"&gt;G7&lt;/a&gt; summit. They discussed the ongoing situation in Ukraine, with Modi emphasizing the importance of "dialogue and diplomacy." He reiterated that India would continue to support a peaceful resolution, according to the meeting's official handout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This marked the second in-person meeting between the two leaders since the all-out war began, the first being at last year's G7 summit in Japan. Given the closure of Ukrainian airspace, world leaders have been traveling to Ukraine via Poland. It is expected that Modi will follow this route and hold discussions with Polish leadership, including Prime Minister Donald Tusk, ahead of his visit to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/kuleba-calls-on-hong-kong-authorities-to-close-sanctions-circumvention-routes-for-russia/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/kuleba-calls-on-hong-kong-authorities-to-close-sanctions-circumvention-routes-for-russia/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/kuleba-calls-on-hong-kong-authorities-to-close-sanctions-circumvention-routes-for-russia/"&gt;Kuleba calls on Hong Kong to close sanctions circumvention routes for Russia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/kuleba-calls-on-hong-kong-authorities-to-close-sanctions-circumvention-routes-for-russia/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/kuleba-calls-on-hong-kong-authorities-to-close-sanctions-circumvention-routes-for-russia/"&gt;Ukraine&#8217;s foreign minister said that these restrictive measures are necessary to &#8220;weaken Russia&#8217;s potential to wage war and kill people in Ukraine.&#8221;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/kuleba-calls-on-hong-kong-authorities-to-close-sanctions-circumvention-routes-for-russia/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/kuleba-calls-on-hong-kong-authorities-to-close-sanctions-circumvention-routes-for-russia/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Indian PM Modi to visit Ukraine in August, media reports say" src="https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/size/w256h256/format/png/2023/03/K-new.svg" /&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Kyiv Independent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kateryna Hodunova&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/kuleba-calls-on-hong-kong-authorities-to-close-sanctions-circumvention-routes-for-russia/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/kuleba-calls-on-hong-kong-authorities-to-close-sanctions-circumvention-routes-for-russia/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/kuleba-calls-on-hong-kong-authorities-to-close-sanctions-circumvention-routes-for-russia/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Indian PM Modi to visit Ukraine in August, media reports say" src="https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-2031345428.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/kuleba-calls-on-hong-kong-authorities-to-close-sanctions-circumvention-routes-for-russia/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jul 2024 22:53:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Romania denies downing Russian drones over Ukraine</title><link>https://kyivindependent.com/romania-denies-downing-russian-drones/</link><description>&lt;img alt="Romania denies downing Russian drones over Ukraine" src="https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1574663962.jpg" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Videos on social media that purport to show Romanian air defense units shooting down Russian attack drones above Ukraine are spreading a false narrative, Romania's Defense Ministry said in a statement on July 26. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/mapn.ro/posts/pfbid02F922gfs5PoTg3PQ8H3X6DDmHWzSN5BFs39ZijnYd1JfZ9Y2uAYybz1r5GhLUjamql"&gt;Romania's Defense Ministry&lt;/a&gt; said that the videos falsely spread "the idea that Romania was targeted by the Russian Federation's drone attacks" against Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The claims have "no real basis" as &lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/tag/russia/"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; was targeting Ukraine's port infrastructure on the Danube and not targets in &lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/tag/romania/"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;, the Defense Ministry said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia launched a drone attack against Izmail in southwestern Ukraine overnight on July 24. The port city lies on the Danube River, which forms the border between Romania and &lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/tag/ukraine/"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attack led the Romanian Air Force to scramble its F-16 fighter jets. Drone &lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/romania-confirms-russian-drone-debris-landed-on-its-territory/"&gt;debris was found&lt;/a&gt; on July 25 in Plauru in Romania, just across the Danube from Izmail. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The caption of one video shared thousands of times on X claimed that Romania had downed Russian drones over Ukrainian airspace using Gepard self-propelled anti-aircraft guns during the attack. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Romanian forces "deployed in the border area with Ukraine did not, in any such situation, fire on the means of attack of Russian Federation," the Defense Ministry said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In order to shoot them down, we have to fire on the territory of Ukraine, and I don&#8217;t think this is allowed yet, I have not heard of any decision in this regard," Romanian Prime Minister &lt;a href="https://adevarul.ro/stiri-interne/evenimente/ciolacu-despre-dronele-rusesti-cazute-in-romania-2377837.html"&gt;Marcel Ciolacu&lt;/a&gt; said on July 26.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These drones are usually hit by the Ukrainian artillery and immediately fall on the bank of the Danube. There is still absolutely no danger for Romanians in the area," Ciolacu added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Romania has taken measures to protect its citizens who live close to the Ukrainian border, including the construction of &lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/romania-to-intrudce-air-raid-alerts-shelters-in-response-to-russian-danube-strikes/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;air raid shelters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the deployment of &lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/media-romania-to-install-anti-drone-defense-system/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;drone defense systems&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/russia-using-new-type-of-drone/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/russia-using-new-type-of-drone/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/russia-using-new-type-of-drone/"&gt;Russia using new, cheap drones to locate Ukraine&#8217;s air defense, military intelligence says&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/russia-using-new-type-of-drone/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/russia-using-new-type-of-drone/"&gt;Russia is now launching a new type of cheaply-made drones to identify air defense systems and act as decoys, Andrii Cherniak, a spokesperson of Ukraine&#8217;s military intelligence, told Reuters in an interview published on July 26.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/russia-using-new-type-of-drone/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/russia-using-new-type-of-drone/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Romania denies downing Russian drones over Ukraine" src="https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/size/w256h256/format/png/2023/03/K-new.svg" /&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Kyiv Independent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Elsa Court&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/russia-using-new-type-of-drone/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/russia-using-new-type-of-drone/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/russia-using-new-type-of-drone/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Romania denies downing Russian drones over Ukraine" src="https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2088409840.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/russia-using-new-type-of-drone/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jul 2024 20:22:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Ukraine to receive nearly $8 billion in direct budget support from US by November, ambassador says</title><link>https://kyivindependent.com/us-funds-by-october-ukrainian-ambassador-to-us-says/</link><description>&lt;img alt="Ukraine to receive nearly $8 billion in direct budget support from US by November, ambassador says" src="https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/gettyimages-1239964248-1-1673310274h9n3g.jpg" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ukraine will receive $7.9 billion in direct support to the state budget by November this year, part of the $61 billion aid package passed by the U.S. Congress in April, Ukrainian ambassador to the U.S., Oksana Markarova, said on July 26.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After months of political infighting and a deteriorating situation on the battlefield in Ukraine, the U.S. House of Representatives finally &lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-us-house-passes-61-billion-in-aid-navy-confirms-russian-ship-hit-in-sevastopol/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;passed the crucial foreign aid package&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on April 20, which included $60.84 billion in support for Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The $7.9 billion in direct budget aid from the package will be transferred to Ukraine "in the near future," while the rest will be received by the end of October, &lt;a href="https://glavcom.ua/country/society/stalo-vidomo-koli-ukrajina-otrimaje-usju-finansovu-dopomohi-vid-ssha-1012158.html"&gt;Markarova said&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That is, by the end of October, all budget aid funds will be received and used by Ukraine," Markarova added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Markarova was referring to direct economic support to Ukraine's state budget, which will help Kyiv keep essential public services running. The economic assistance takes the form of a loan that can be forgiven by the U.S. president.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal, Ukraine has received at least &lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/shmyhal-ukraine-has-received-12-billion-in-international-aid-this-year-to-help-cover-budget-deficit/"&gt;$12 billion&lt;/a&gt; in external financing since the beginning of the year to help the Ukrainian government address its budget deficit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an address to the World Bank and International Monetary Fund forum last October, Shmyhal &lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/shmyhal-ukraine-facing-42-billion-budget-deficit-in-2024/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;noted&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that Ukraine would require nearly $42 billion in economic assistance in 2024 to offset the deficit. &#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These funds are crucial for financing state-provided services like healthcare, salaries for medical workers and teachers, and social programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/pentagon-finds-accounting-errors-worth-2-billion-in-aid-for-ukraine/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/pentagon-finds-accounting-errors-worth-2-billion-in-aid-for-ukraine/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/pentagon-finds-accounting-errors-worth-2-billion-in-aid-for-ukraine/"&gt;Pentagon finds accounting errors worth $2 billion in aid for Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/pentagon-finds-accounting-errors-worth-2-billion-in-aid-for-ukraine/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/pentagon-finds-accounting-errors-worth-2-billion-in-aid-for-ukraine/"&gt;Due to the errors, the Defense Department can send a further $2 billion in weapons to Ukraine to cover the amount already approved by U.S. President Joe Biden.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/pentagon-finds-accounting-errors-worth-2-billion-in-aid-for-ukraine/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/pentagon-finds-accounting-errors-worth-2-billion-in-aid-for-ukraine/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Ukraine to receive nearly $8 billion in direct budget support from US by November, ambassador says" src="https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/size/w256h256/format/png/2023/03/K-new.svg" /&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Kyiv Independent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Abbey Fenbert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/pentagon-finds-accounting-errors-worth-2-billion-in-aid-for-ukraine/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/pentagon-finds-accounting-errors-worth-2-billion-in-aid-for-ukraine/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/pentagon-finds-accounting-errors-worth-2-billion-in-aid-for-ukraine/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Ukraine to receive nearly $8 billion in direct budget support from US by November, ambassador says" src="https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/--------------2024-03-19-202210.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/pentagon-finds-accounting-errors-worth-2-billion-in-aid-for-ukraine/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jul 2024 19:43:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Russia using new, cheap drones to locate Ukraine's air defense, military intelligence says</title><link>https://kyivindependent.com/russia-using-new-type-of-drone/</link><description>&lt;img alt="Russia using new, cheap drones to locate Ukraine's air defense, military intelligence says" src="https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2088409840.jpg" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia is now launching a new type of cheaply-made drone to identify air defense systems and act as decoys, Andrii Cherniak, a spokesperson of Ukraine's military intelligence, told Reuters in an interview published on July 26.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia has launched thousands of cheap but &lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/explainer-irans-cheap-effective-shahed-drones-and-how-russia-uses-them-in-ukraine/"&gt;effective Shahed-type drones&lt;/a&gt; against Ukraine since the fall of 2022. First used on the battlefield, they are now typically deployed to target energy infrastructure and cities far from the front line, such as Kyiv. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Cherniak, Russia is now using not only &lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/tag/shahed-drones/"&gt;Shahed-type drones&lt;/a&gt; but also a new type of drone made of plywood and plastic foam in long-range attacks against Ukraine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new drones can reveal the location of air defense systems and film damage, with one type able to carry a camera and Ukrainian sim card to send footage back to Russia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They identify where our mobile groups are positioned, where the machine guns are that can destroy them," &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-deploys-cheap-drones-locate-ukraines-air-defences-2024-07-26/"&gt;Cherniak told Reuters&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russian forces are trying "to get a picture of where all our air defenses are located," he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drones have been used in five attacks in July, including an overnight strike on July 25-26, Cherniak said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cherniak's comments follow a report by the &lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/debris-shows-russia-targeted-kyiv-with-new-unidentified-drone/"&gt;Ukrainian Air Force&lt;/a&gt; on July 20 that a new unidentified drone had targeted Kyiv overnight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Images of the downed &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nexta_tv/status/1814658657268720104"&gt;drone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; circulating on social media indicate that the new weapon does not resemble a Shahed-type drone. The drone was reportedly flying at a low altitude of 20-30 meters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The news outlet Defense Express obtained additional photographs and details about the unidentified drone.

Individual officials of the command brigade have been brought to justice," it added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The inspection was &lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/syrskyi-59th-motorized-brigade/"&gt;ordered by Oleksandr Syrskyi&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month and came only a day after Azovstal defender and medic Kateryna Polishchuk, known under the nickname Ptashka ("Birdie"), called on Syrskyi and President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the unit over the alleged misconduct of its commander, Bohdan Shevchuk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Since thousands of soldiers remain in the combat zone under Shevchuk's leadership, I ask you, Commander-in-Chief, to pay heed and conduct an internal investigation," &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=pfbid0CP28pTUuAtA3AuawybMH4F2YVB1ZYsN7MoFqbTT2RddiUTkoGauW4zEEV2JNx1pUl&amp;amp;id=100086278774417"&gt;Polishchuk&lt;/a&gt; wrote in a Facebook post on July 14, accusing Shevchuk of "criminal orders, negligence, actions that resulted in the deaths of a large number of troops," as well as careerism, removal of dissenting commanders, and other transgressions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When announcing the investigation on July 15, Ukraine's General Staff did not explicitly name Polishchuk nor Shevchuk and did not mention specific circumstances that led to the start of the probe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 59th Brigade is deployed near Krasnohorivka in Donetsk Oblast, a front-line town under &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/GeneralStaff.ua/posts/pfbid0SCBkWTrfXfKLfGmxRoLYbtZKoBraoA8oG27ak8re2q33A9LW8it6dSSxWKN1SZecl"&gt;heavy pressure&lt;/a&gt; by Russian forces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polishchuk was captured by Russia in May 2022 after &lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/tag/azovstal/"&gt;Azovstal&lt;/a&gt;, a metallurgical plant that served as Ukraine's last remaining holdout in besieged &lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/tag/mariupol/"&gt;Mariupol&lt;/a&gt;, fell into Russian hands. The medic was released alongside &lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-returns-some-azovstal-defenders-from-russian-captivity/"&gt;over 200 defenders&lt;/a&gt; in the fall of the same year, joining the 59th Brigade and returning to the front soon after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While praising the unit's previous commanders, Polishchuk said that Shevchuk was appointed to the position in April 2024 through "family ties in the top military leadership."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Because of Shevchuk's inhuman and unprofessional attitude, I was forced to stop cooperating" with this unit, Polishchuk wrote, adding that "not everybody has the chance to resist the criminal orders aimed solely at winning extra stars by this man."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polishchuk left the military last month, referring to "painful changes" in her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, Zelensky dismissed Commander of the Joint Forces Lieutenant General &lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-appoints-new-combined-forces-airborne-territorial-defense-commanders/"&gt;Yurii Sodol&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lieutenant Colonel Bohdan Krotevych, one of the &lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/"&gt;Azov &lt;/a&gt;Brigade's commanders, said on June 23 that he filed an official complaint to the &lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/tag/state-bureau-of-investigation/"&gt;State Bureau of Investigation&lt;/a&gt;

on May 15, following Russia's spring campaign of strikes against Ukraine's energy infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deficit in the energy system intensified in mid-July, when a &lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/heat-wave-pushes-electricity-consumption-to-maximum/"&gt;heatwave pushed&lt;/a&gt; electricity consumption in the country to its maximum level. "We have every reason to expect that the most difficult period of the summer is behind us," Kudrytskyi said at a briefing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cooler weather has led to a fall in energy consumption, while certain power plants have completed their repairs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Instead of a complex scheme of three to four groups, we have one to two, which will be applied depending on the time," Kudrytskyi said, referring to the groups that addresses are sorted into during rolling blackouts. &#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kudrytskyi said the situation would continue to improve "if there were no new large-scale damages to power plants."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/incident-south-ukraine-nuclear-power-plant/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/incident-south-ukraine-nuclear-power-plant/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/incident-south-ukraine-nuclear-power-plant/"&gt;MP confirms equipment damage at nuclear power plant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/incident-south-ukraine-nuclear-power-plant/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/incident-south-ukraine-nuclear-power-plant/"&gt;Reports emerged on July 18 that two transformers had burned down days earlier, leading to one of the reactors being disconnected from the energy network.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/incident-south-ukraine-nuclear-power-plant/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/incident-south-ukraine-nuclear-power-plant/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Ukraine's energy situation improving, state grid operator says" src="https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/size/w256h256/format/png/2023/03/K-new.svg" /&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Kyiv Independent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Elsa Court&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/incident-south-ukraine-nuclear-power-plant/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/incident-south-ukraine-nuclear-power-plant/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/incident-south-ukraine-nuclear-power-plant/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Ukraine's energy situation improving, state grid operator says" src="https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1600485522.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/incident-south-ukraine-nuclear-power-plant/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jul 2024 15:41:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Long an Olympic powerhouse, Russia has the smallest participation in 30 years</title><link>https://kyivindependent.com/long-an-olympic-powerhouse-russia-has-the-smallest-participation-in-30-years/</link><description>&lt;img alt="Long an Olympic powerhouse, Russia has the smallest participation in 30 years" src="https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2161898011.jpg" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia, as well as the Soviet Union before it, has long sought to use international sporting spectacles as an opportunity to demonstrate the nation's athletic prowess and improve its prestige on the global stage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2014 Winter Olympics, held in Sochi, Russia, just days before unmarked Russian troops began the&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/russias-annexation-of-crimea/"&gt; illegal takeover of Ukraine's Crimea&lt;/a&gt;, was a high point for the country's Olympic ambitions and a widely cited source of national pride. The games were often characterized as a "&lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26062757"&gt;pet project&lt;/a&gt;" for Russian President &lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/tag/vladimir-putin/"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time, Putin expressed hope that the international competition would "build bridges" and help promote a more positive vision of &lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/tag/russia/"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; around the world. The 2014 Olympics, the most expensive in history, nonetheless became associated with many of the negative stereotypes long connected to Russia &#8212; corruption, cronyism, inflated prices, abuse of migrant workers, and other less-than-savory details. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The games were still considered to be mostly successful, even if eventually overshadowed by the illegal annexation of Crimea and the ensuing &lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/the-origins-of-the-2014-war-in-donbas/"&gt;aggression against Ukraine&lt;/a&gt; that followed shortly after. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ten years later, Russia's meager participation in the 2024 Paris Olympics, which kicked off on July 26, is a far cry from that high point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;code&gt;Bare-bones participation in 2024 games&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia had already been banned from officially participating in both the 2020 and 2022 Olympic Games for widespread doping. Though the ban was lifted in 2023, most Russian athletes were barred from the next games due to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" /&gt;&lt;source type="image/jpg" /&gt;&lt;img alt="Long an Olympic powerhouse, Russia has the smallest participation in 30 years" height="682" src="https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1238647150.jpg" width="1024" /&gt;The Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) flag flies at the closing ceremony of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, China, on Feb. 20, 2022. (Michael Kappeler/picture alliance via Getty Images)&lt;p&gt;The Executive Board of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) ruled in December 2023 that Russian and Belarusian athletes will be &lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/russian-belarusian-athletes-allowed-to-compete-as-neutral-athletes-at-paris-olympics-in-2024/"&gt;allowed to compete&lt;/a&gt; in the Olympic Games in Paris as Individual Neutral Athletes (AINs) with "strict eligibility conditions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the rules, Russian and Belarusian athletes cannot participate as teams nor &lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/russia-accuses-olympic-committee-of-racism-and-neo-nazism-over-opening-ceremony-decision/"&gt;display any flags&lt;/a&gt; or official identification with either country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rules also stipulate that athletes or members of their team who have openly supported the war or have been affiliated with the military or security organizations of Russia or Belarus are barred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An investigation by the human rights group Global Rights Compliance earlier in July found that as many as &lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/russian-olympic-athletes-violate-neutrality-rules/"&gt;two-thirds of the Russian athletes&lt;/a&gt; permitted to join the games have violated neutrality rules by displaying public support for the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In light of the heavy scrutiny and strict conditions, just 15 Russian athletes have qualified to appear at the Paris games. This is the lowest number of Russian athletes competing in the Olympics in 30 years, since the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, when Russia first competed separately from the Soviet Union and the United Team. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even under the restrictions in place at the 2022 Winter Olympics, more than 200 Russian athletes participated under the designation of the "Russian Olympic Committee."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, Russian athletes will compete in cycling, kayaking and canoeing, tennis, swimming and trampoline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ukraine will be &lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-to-be-represented-at-2024-olympics-by-smallest-number-of-athletes-in-history/"&gt;represented by 140 athletes&lt;/a&gt;, also the smallest in the history of the country's participation in the games. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia's full-scale invasion has killed at least &lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-athletes-who-will-never-have-a-chance-to-compete-at-the-olympics/"&gt;488 Ukrainian athletes and coaches&lt;/a&gt; since 2022, according to Ukraine's Youth and Sports Ministry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" /&gt;&lt;source type="image/jpg" /&gt;&lt;img alt="Long an Olympic powerhouse, Russia has the smallest participation in 30 years" height="683" src="https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2161904303--1-.jpg" width="1024" /&gt;Vlada Kharkova, a Ukrainian right-handed epee fencer and 2022 individual European champion, is seen during training for the Olympic Games in Paris at the Ukrainian National Olympic Base training camp in Koncha-Zaspa in Kyiv, Ukraine on July 17, 2024.

We're not sure, but it looks like it is fake and has been spread by pro-Kremlin and pro-Russian channels."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;French authorities&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/france-ban-russians-belarusians-suspected-of-foreign-interference-from-attending-paris-olympics/"&gt; barred dozens of Russian and Belarusian nationals&lt;/a&gt; from receiving accreditation to be present at the games, citing concerns of potential foreign interference, cybersecurity threats, disinformation, and other reasons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" /&gt;&lt;source type="image/jpg" /&gt;&lt;img alt="Long an Olympic powerhouse, Russia has the smallest participation in 30 years" height="683" src="https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2161898087.jpg" width="1024" /&gt;A woman during a march in memory of the hundreds of Ukrainian athletes killed since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine on July 13, 2024, in Paris, France.

The street will now be named after Maik Yohansen, a Ukrainian poet of Latvian ancestry who rose to prominence in &lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/tag/kharkiv/"&gt;Kharkiv&lt;/a&gt; in the 1920s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Soviet authorities accused Yohansen of being part of a "Ukrainian bourgeois-nationalist terrorist organization." He was executed by firing squad in 1937. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tchaikovsky Street will be renamed after another Ukrainian poet executed in 1937, Mykhailo Semenko, who is considered the founder of Ukrainian futurist poetry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The targeting of Ukrainian cultural figures in the 1930s was so widespread that those who were murdered are referred to in Ukraine as the "&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/how-russia-has-attempted-to-erase-ukrainian-language-culture-throughout-centuries/"&gt;Executed Rennaisance&lt;/a&gt;." Many of those who were killed were living and working in Kharkiv, the capital of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic from 1919 to 1934.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other renamings will have more modern references. One street will be named after the &lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/failure-or-feint-taking-stock-of-russias-bogged-down-move-on-kharkiv-2/"&gt;92nd Assault Brigade&lt;/a&gt;, while another street will be named after the &lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-writer-and-musician-serhiy-zhadan-decides-to-join/"&gt;Khartiia Brigade of the National Guard&lt;/a&gt;. Both brigades fought in the Battle of Kharkiv in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new names were chosen by a special working group of the Kharkiv City Council, which included local historians, scientists, and members of the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The working group held nine meetings, discussing all proposals in detail," Syniehubov said.

"Labour shortages continue to grow."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data from Russia's Federal Statistics Service shows that the country has faced six months in a row of &lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/russia-faces-6th-straight-month-of-price-growth-bloomberg-reports/"&gt;growing prices&lt;/a&gt; that particularly impact the cost of fuel and food.

The figure is significantly higher than that of the U.S., which is expected to be &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/09/business/economy/powell-inflation-rate-cut.html?searchResultPosition=1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;around 3.1%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for the month of June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia is burdened by enormous defense spending stemming from its full-scale war against Ukraine, which rose to almost 30% of its budget in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia's "monetary policy needs to be tightened further," so that the inflation rate can be brought towards the target of 4%, the Central Bank said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia's Central Bank claimed that "consumer activity remains high amid a significant increase in households' incomes and positive consumer sentiment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Levada Center poll in June showed that only 29% of respondents were very or somewhat &lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/poll-only-11-of-russians-say-sanctions-have-personally-affected-them-or-their-family/"&gt;worried about global sanctions&lt;/a&gt; against Russia, down from 45% who said they were worried in March 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The poll also showed that only 11% of respondents said that sanctions had personally affected them or their families. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/russia-tries-to-keep-financial-system-under-control-as-military-spending-soars/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/russia-tries-to-keep-financial-system-under-control-as-military-spending-soars/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/russia-tries-to-keep-financial-system-under-control-as-military-spending-soars/"&gt;Russia struggles to control finances as Ukraine invasion spending soars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/russia-tries-to-keep-financial-system-under-control-as-military-spending-soars/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/russia-tries-to-keep-financial-system-under-control-as-military-spending-soars/"&gt;Since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in 2022, the Russian government has focused all of its financial resources on funding the war.

Excuse me, I do know such a country &#8211; the Ukrainian People's Republic in 1918. At that time, Defense Minister Mykola Porsh submitted a draft law on demobilization to the Central Rada," Stefanchuk said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is very important to me that the current Verkhovna Rada (&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/tag/parliament/"&gt;Ukraine's parliament&lt;/a&gt;) does not repeat the 'mistake' of the Central Rada."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Central Rada was an analog of the parliament in the times of the short-lived Ukrainian People's Republic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Vitalii Skalskyi, director of the Ukrainian Research Institute of Archival Affairs and Records Management, it is a common misconception that the Ukrainian People's Republic carried out demobilization of its regular army in January 1918, eventually leading to its defeat in the war with the Bolsheviks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Skalskyi argues that it wasn't the demobilization of the Ukrainian army, but the &lt;a href="https://www.istpravda.com.ua/articles/5a7c665b9a13a/"&gt;remnants of the old Russian imperial army&lt;/a&gt; in Ukraine. &#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They were absolutely incapable and had no burning desire to fight for Ukraine," Skalskyi told the Kyiv Independent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, Stefanchuk said that the Ukrainian military on the front line "has an exclusive right to justice," which is why it is necessary to provide them with vacations, rotations, or other "privileges." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stefanchuk believes these issues were partially resolved after the new &lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-signs-mobilization-bill/"&gt;law on mobilization&lt;/a&gt; was adopted in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most Ukrainian soldiers cannot legally demobilize. The grounds for demobilization may include health problems or the need to care for sick family members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April, before the law on &lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/tag/mobilization/"&gt;mobilization&lt;/a&gt; was voted on in the second reading, the provisions on demobilization and rotation were removed from it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Defense Ministry said that the parliamentary committee had instructed it to develop a new law within eight months that would deal specifically with rotation and demobilization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ministry later announced in April that it plans to submit the draft law to the parliament in "the next few months." It has not been introduced yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/digitalization-lifts-ukraines-army-mobilization-efforts-but-is-it-enough/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/digitalization-lifts-ukraines-army-mobilization-efforts-but-is-it-enough/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/digitalization-lifts-ukraines-army-mobilization-efforts-but-is-it-enough/"&gt;Ukraine&#8217;s mobilization effort gets boost as millions update draft data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/digitalization-lifts-ukraines-army-mobilization-efforts-but-is-it-enough/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/digitalization-lifts-ukraines-army-mobilization-efforts-but-is-it-enough/"&gt;By early 2024, 40-year-old Pavlo Kovtoniuk had begun to understand that Russia&#8217;s two-year-long full-scale war against his country would require him to serve in the army sooner or later.

She underwent an operation but was pronounced dead later that night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On July 25, the &lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/suspect-in-murder-of-ex-mp-farion-detained-in-dnipro-zelensky-says/"&gt;suspect&lt;/a&gt; in the murder of Farion was detained in Dnipro, a city in central-eastern Ukraine, nearly 1,000 kilometers away from Lviv. According to the investigation, the suspect is an 18-year-old resident of Dnipro, Viacheslav Zinchenko.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apart from potential involvement in the Russian neo-Nazi movement, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/vxqwJIgWTs0?si=1Tw2rxQiQjilv7-i"&gt;law enforcement services&lt;/a&gt; are also currently investigating the suspect's contacts in Ukraine and the motives for the crime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko added that the investigation does not rule out personal animosity toward Farion as a potential motive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/who-was-iryna-farion-the-nationalist-professor-politician-assassinated-in-lviv/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/who-was-iryna-farion-the-nationalist-professor-politician-assassinated-in-lviv/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/who-was-iryna-farion-the-nationalist-professor-politician-assassinated-in-lviv/"&gt;Who was Iryna Farion, the nationalist professor-politician assassinated in Lviv?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/who-was-iryna-farion-the-nationalist-professor-politician-assassinated-in-lviv/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/who-was-iryna-farion-the-nationalist-professor-politician-assassinated-in-lviv/"&gt;Despite the contrasting opinions surrounding her life&#8217;s work and sometimes contentious public statements, the assassination of linguist and former right-wing lawmaker Iryna Farion on July 19 came as a shock to Ukrainians.

Readovka also described the NS/WP as "neo-Nazi."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ukrainian police were examining the claims published on Russian social media, a police spokesperson told the media on the next day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Law enforcement agencies previously said they do not rule out the involvement of Russian actors in the murder of the former lawmaker and linguist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Farion was a linguistics professor who previously served in the parliament for the nationalist Svoboda party. She was considered a controversial figure in Ukraine, among other reasons, due to her &lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/sbu-charges-ex-mp-over-student-message-leak/"&gt;incendiary statements&lt;/a&gt;
